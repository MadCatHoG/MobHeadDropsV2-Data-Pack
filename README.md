# MobHeadDropsV2 Data Pack for Minecraft 1.13
This is a Data Pack that allows mobs to drop their heads. This project is a combination of my old Command Block contraption MobHeadDrops and Carl Poole's version of Xisuma's More Mob Heads.

To enable the datapack, copy the zip file under the releases directory into your map's "datapacks" folder. If your server is running, make sure to run /reload.
